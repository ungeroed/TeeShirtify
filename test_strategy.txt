Brief notes on testing strategy:

Manual testing:
First of all I would manually attempt to crash the app. To catch it off guard, starting simultaneous downloads or load taxing views swiftly after another. 

ADB Monkey:
i would use the monkey utility from the adb to to pressure the app and to attempt to crash it to find bugs. 
Note: handing the device to children is also a viable option here :-)

Unit testing:
I would test all public methods and employ a fast proxy service to mock and test data communication. (just a basic service using either node or python flask etc.).

UI testing:
i would attempt to use the automated UI testing tool, although I find its succesrate  hit and miss. 

I guess that pretty much covers it.
